                    <h3>Examining the Disparities between Public and Private Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S.</h3>
                    <p>The project "Examining the Disparities between Public and Private Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S." utilized python along with linear regression, chi-square tests, and contingency tables to analyze the differences in health insurance coverage. It aimed to identify factors influencing coverage types and reveal disparities between public and private sectors. The insights gained contribute to addressing inequalities and improving access to healthcare services.</p>

                    <h3>Examining Influential Factors on Poverty Status</h3>
                    <p>The project "Examining Influential Factors on Poverty Status" employed logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest modeling, and clustering techniques to analyze and understand the factors contributing to poverty. By exploring various statistical models, the project aimed to identify the significant predictors of poverty and uncover patterns and clusters within the dataset. The insights gained from this analysis provide valuable information for policymakers and organizations working towards poverty alleviation and socioeconomic development.</p>

                    <h3>AirBnB Listings</h3>
                    <p>For this project, I created an app that focuses on displaying AirBnB listings specifically around a particular landmark or location. By leveraging Numpy, the app efficiently manages and manipulates data to provide users with a curated list of AirBnB accommodations near their desired landmark. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily explore and filter listings based on their preferences, making it convenient to find the perfect AirBnB stay for their needs.</p>

                <p>In my spare time, I have a deep passion for music, particularly rap and R&B genres, as well as pop culture. I find great joy in attending concerts and live performances, and I'm excited to have several lined up on my schedule for this year. The energy and artistry of live music never fail to inspire and uplift me.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Beyond my love for music and pop culture, I am actively involved in serving my community, with a special focus on supporting the homeless and foster children. I find fulfillment in volunteering and contributing to organizations that provide assistance and resources to those in need. Making a positive impact in the lives of others, especially vulnerable populations, is a cause that is close to my heart.</p>
